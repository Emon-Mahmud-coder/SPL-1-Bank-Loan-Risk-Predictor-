# Loan Risk Prediction System (SPL-1)

This project is a high-performance C++ implementation of a **Random Forest algorithm** designed to predict loan default risks. It analyzes applicant data such as credit scores, income, and debt-to-income ratios to provide a risk assessment and banking recommendations.

## 🚀 Current Project Status
- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation** - Core data structures and applicant models defined.
- [x] **Phase 2: Data Engineering** - Categorical encoders and input validation utilities implemented.
- [x] **Phase 3: Data Processing** - CSV loading engine and statistical analysis.
- [x] **Phase 4: Data Validation** - CSV loading engine and Data Validation.
- [ ] **Phase 5: ML Core** - Gini impurity calculations and Decision Tree building.
- [ ] **Phase 6: Random Forest** - Forest training and majority voting logic.
- [ ] **Phase 7: Analysis & UI** - Risk factor reporting and user interface(currently no user interface implemented).
